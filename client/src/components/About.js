              The <b>MIPS Translator</b> website is a tool designed for students who are learning how to code in the <b>MIPS assembly language</b>. 
              It is a quick way to understand how <b>MIPS operations</b> are translated into <b>program instructions</b>.
              MIPS assembly language simply refers to the assembly language of the <b>MIPS processor</b>. 
              The term MIPS is an acronym for <b>Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages</b>. 
              It is a reduced-instruction set architecture developed by an organization called <b>MIPS Technologies</b>.
              The MIPS assembly language is a very useful language to learn because many <b>embedded systems</b> run on the MIPS processor. 
              Knowing how to code in this language brings a <b>deeper understanding</b> of how these systems operate on a <b>lower level</b>.
